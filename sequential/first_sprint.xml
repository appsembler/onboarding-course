      <p>As a newcomer you should:</p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Not commit to more than <strong>3 points</strong>
          of tasks during your first week, or 5 points your second week
          (so 8 points in a two-week sprint).
          It's really easy to over-commit at first, so keep your commitments manageable.
          If you finish early you can always ask in the
          <a href="https://chat.opencraft.com/opencraft/channels/sprint-planning"><em>Sprint planning</em></a>
          channel whether someone needs any help,
          and take on more work later in the sprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide lots of updates to your assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
          so they can provide timely help.
        </li>

        Please participate in the grooming session (point estimation) that
        the team does at the end of each sprint.
        Usually you should get an email about this and can follow the link
        to reach the estimation page, but if not, try
        <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/projects/OC?selectedItem=com.spartez.jira.plugins.jiraplanningpoker:pokerng-project-side-panel-link&amp;rapidView=5&amp;source=sidebar" target="_blank">this link</a>
        to see if you have been invited to any session. When grooming, you
        don't have to provide a number of points for every issue (or even
        most) - put '?' if you don't feel you have enough knowledge to
        estimate a task.
