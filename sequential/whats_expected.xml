        We have prepared the descriptions of different roles in OpenCraft
        in the form of <strong><em>What's expected of me</em></strong> docs.
        If some of them (like sprint firefighter or discovery duty) don't apply to you yet,
        take note at least of how you as a newcomer can benefit from what they do.
        Let's read them!

        First, let's read general expectations for the team member of OpenCraft:
      </p>
    </html>

    <html url_name="whats_expected_opencraft_team_member_2">
      <h4>General</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I can work from wherever I want, provided I have access
          to a reliable high-bandwidth internet connection good enough for video calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can set my own work schedule, and work when I want during the week,
          as long as <strong>I remain available to answer to others</strong>
          (please see: the <strong>Communication</strong> section below)
        </li>
        <li>
          (In general) <strong>I am expected <em>not</em> to work weekends</strong>
          (unless I'm behind on my commitments), which should remain an exception, not the rule!
          If you find yourself working on week ends more than once per month, that likely reflects
          an issue with your time management that needs fixing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will work at least the amount of hours per week that is
          specified in my contract (e.g. 40 hours/week),
          averaged over each month, excluding scheduled holiday time.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will ensure that clients and people on the team that I'll be working with
          (e.g. code reviews) know my availability.
          (e.g. If I'm taking Friday off, I'll make sure people who need me
          to do code review know that).
        </li>
        <li>
          When taking time off follow the procedure described on the
          <a href="/jump_to_id/opencraft_vacation">vacation's section</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If I'm unexpectedly sick or unavailable due to an emergency,
          I'll make every effort to notify the team and ask the sprint firefighters
          to take over my duties.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will provide my own hardware (laptop).
        </li>
        <li>
          I will keep my computer(s) secure and up to date as described in the
          <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/Security_policy.md">Security Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will record all hours that I spend on a task using the Tempo timesheets
          tool in JIRA (including things like setting up devstacks and time spent
          learning, which we all need to do and is an important part of the task,
          especially at the beginning, or when joining a project).
        </li>
        <li>
          If I use another tool for tracking my time,
          I will update the JIRA Tempo timesheets within 24 hours (excluding weekend days).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </html>

    <html url_name="whats_expected_opencraft_team_member_3">
      <h4>
        Communication
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>If any client email is addressed to me, I will respond to it within 24 hours(excluding weekend days), or ensure that someone else on the team does.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I will CC or forward to
              <a href="mailto:help@opencraft.com">help@opencraft.com</a>
              all client emails and replies, so that others can take over
              the thread with that client if needed, or refer to it for context.
            </li>
            <li>
              If I can't answer immediately, I will at least send a quick reply
              to let them know we're working on a response.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I will reply to pings/emails from other OpenCraft team members within 24 hours</strong>
          (again excluding weekend days and scheduled time off).
          <ul>
            <li>
              But this should be a "worst case" scenario - completing the work on time
              is still the primary goal, so when someone is blocked and pings me for help,
              I will try to do as much as I can to unblock them quickly,
              rather than starting a 24h ping-pong cycle that takes up all the time
              in the sprint without accomplishing any work.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I will be professional and polite when communicating with clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will prefer asynchronous over synchronous processes
          (keep meetings to a minimum). A chat conversation is a form of a meeting.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Generally, discussions should happen first asynchronously on the JIRA tickets;
              if there is really something that can't be efficiently sorted out asynchronously,
              have a chat or schedule a meeting. JIRA might have long response cycles (around
              1 day turnaround). If this time isn't enough to unblock someone and
              finish their sprint commitments, use Mattermost, even though
              it's more disruptive to people's workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you do have a synchronous conversation with someone about a particular task,
              post a summary of the result/decision from that conversation on the JIRA ticket
              for easier future reference.
            </li>
            <li>
              When scheduling meetings, give them a precise agenda. For people using Calendly,
              like Braden and Xavier, book meetings there, as it allows us to avoid
              the scheduling overhead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try, as much as possible, to use a similar approach with clients - don't
              let them invade your days with meetings. Calendly is good for this too,
              as it allows to define time slots where you'll have the meetings,
              to minimize the disruption they cause to your day and productivity.
              If you want a calendly account, let Xavier know and he will set
              you up with the OpenCraft account.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I will post on public channels on Mattermost rather than private 1-to-1 channels
          whenever possible, even if the message is just for one person.
          This allows us to know what others are working on, and helps to replace
          the overheard discussions in physical offices - it can also be an occasion
          for someone else with knowledge about your issue to get the context,
          and to intervene if it is useful to the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will make sure I communicate with my reviewer(s) on tasks about availability
          and timezone overlap if I didn't have knowledge about it before. I will use the
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107dR9H1vWjLpJlXPuBaFJIFaEPEmaSh50xLow_aEGVw/edit" target="_blank">contact sheet</a>
          where necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will join the weekly team meeting on Mondays unless I have scheduled that day off in advance.
        </li>

      <h4>
        Sprint tasks
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I will follow the process and expectations outlined in the
          <em>Pull request process</em>
          section (you'll get to this section soon).
        </li>
        <li>
          I will never add my code (even DevOps code!) to a production branch directly
          - I will always create a Pull Request.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will always ensure my Pull Requests are reviewed by another OpenCraft team member <strong>before</strong> merging,
          except if I am a <em>core team member</em> and I'm merging <em>trivial changes</em>.
          In this exceptional case, I may merge the <em>trivial changes</em> before receiving a review,
          but I will then ensure all of those <em>trivial changes</em>
          are reviewed and acknowledged post-merge or post-deployment
          by another OpenCraft team member. Trivial changes include:
          <ul>
            <li>
                Small Open edX environment tweaks (
                <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/514483/34581710-c167d10c-f191-11e7-9a66-7fa8c59def82.png">example</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
              Minor/bugfix package version bumps (
              <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/ansible-rabbitmq/pull/4/files" target="_blank">example</a>)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I will only commit to work each sprint that I believe I can comfortably complete
          within the allotted sprint time (two weeks).
          Here, "complete" means "get merged or to external review."
        </li>
        <li>
          I will get all of my tasks ready for internal review (by someone else
          on the OpenCraft team) by the
          <strong>end of Wednesday in the second week of the sprint</strong>
          at the latest. This will ensure that there is time for the review to take place,
          and for me to address the review comments
          and get the internal reviewer's approval in time.  If a ticket potentially requires multiple
          review cycles, get it into review as early as possible.  Schedule reviews with your reviewer
          to make sure they have time when you get your work ready for review.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will spend time to plan each task at the beginning of each sprint, including scheduling the
          review with the reviewer. Make sure you have an answer for:
            <ol>
              <li>When do each step of the task need to be completed?</li>
              <li>Which days will you work on which task?</li>
              <li>When do individual parts need to be completed to be on time?</li>
            </ol>
          It's also important to keep some margin on the sprint, in case something doesn't go as expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will get my tasks to at least
          <strong>External Review</strong>
          (or "Merged" if no external review is required) by
          <strong>one hour before the sprint planning meeting for the next sprint</strong>.
          As this is also dependent on the internal reviewer,
          I'll make sure she/he will be available around the time I finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is looking like I will have trouble meeting one of these deadlines,
          I will inform the sprint firefighters (and epic owner) as early as possible,
          so they can get me additional help, start planning for contingencies,
          and/or warn the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          If necessary, I will work overtime to complete my tasks before the end of the sprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will prioritise stories that spilled over from the previous sprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will "work from the right", prioritizing responding to external reviews
          as the highest priority, then doing reviews / responding to questions
          from others on the team, and finally working on implementing my own "In Progress" tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will be helpful to team members, responding to questions,
          helping with debugging, providing advice, or even taking over tasks
          if I have time and they are overloaded. This has precedence over starting
          to work on new tasks, when finishing a sprint early.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a sprint, I will review all of my tasks that are in "Long External Review/Blocked"
          and if needed, I will ping the external reviewer/blocker or pull the task into
          an upcoming sprint.

        As a <strong>code reviewer</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I will give prompt, thoughtful, thorough, constructive code reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          (When reviewing OpenCraft work): I will expect that the PR author
          has done everything outlined in the

          part of the
          <em>Pull request process</em>
          section (you'll get to it soon) - if not, I will ask them
          to fix that before I start the review.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will always read through the code diff, considering things like:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Is the code easily understandable by humans?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the code of high quality?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are all relevant coding standards followed?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are all UX / a11y / i18n considerations addressed?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is this introducing tech debt?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the new code well covered by tests?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I will always test the code manually,
          either locally or on a sandbox, unless there is no reasonable way to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will always check if any updates to the software's documentation are required,
          and either ask the author to update the docs,
          or ensure the relevant documentation team is pinged.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is any part of the code that I am not confident in reviewing,
          I will indicate that in my comments.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is any part of the code or PR that I particularly like,
          I will say so - we want to reinforce good practice as well as flagging issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will
          <a href="https://github.com/settings/replies" target="_blank">set up the following template as a "Saved Reply" in GitHub</a>

        If I'm <strong>new to the team</strong>, I will:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Not commit to more than 3 points of tasks during my first week,
          or 5 points my second week (so no more than a total of 8 points for
          the first sprint).  It's really easy to over-commit at first,
          so keep your commitments manageable. You can always take on more work
          later in the sprint if you finish early.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide lots of updates to my assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
          so they can provide timely help.

      </ol>

      <p>
        Additionally, here are some of the things the core team looks for
        when it comes time to evaluate newcomers near the end of their trial period,
        and some general advice about each of them:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Delivering On-Time: Avoiding spillover and delivering on schedule is really
          important in an environment where we make direct promises to clients about
          deliverables. Our reputation as an organization is on the line when we cannot
          deliver as we promised, so it matters tremendously to us to see a newcomer
          making deadlines consistently. It's required that you communicate explicitly
          when you feel there is going to be spillover, as soon as you can detect it, and
          try to find someone else who can complete or help you complete them. It’s totally
          ok to do this, and even welcomed by people who have time left in their sprint.
          We are a team, and we work together to avoid spillover.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicative: As stressed above, as an international remote team, there is
          little progress we can make if we don't constantly communicate (with respect
          to not being interruptive if it isn't necessarily urgent). We promise you
          that we didn't recruit any mind readers! We won't magically figure anything
          out unless it's been talked about, through any of our multiple modes of communciation.
          You should be communicating with your reviewers daily or every 2 days minimum on what
          your progress on their task is (by commenting on the JIRA tickets). Even if they have
          no questions, just stating status is important and can give reviewers/mentors somewhere
          to jump in and help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Show your skills: It's important to take tasks of progressive difficulty, take
          reviews on too. It's much easier for the core team to review your trial
          if you have picked varied tasks of different complexity and skillset. We’re looking for a
          cross-section of tasks across all our required work areas: full stack dev, devops, and ops.
        </li>
        <li>
          "Nice": This point is in quotes because everyone obviously likes being around
          other nice people, so you'd assume this was obvious. But of course everyone believes,
          "Yeah, I'm nice!", but it goes a long way to being deliberately nice with your
          colleagues, and not just believing you are; they will simply enjoy working with you more.
        </li>
      </ol>

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I will keep at least 10 hours of time for sprint firefighter duties as
          described below, and will proactively pursue those duties.
          I may still plan some tasks to pull into the sprint if no fires pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will not record any time on the
          <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-1199" target="_blank">OC-1199</a>
          task directly (always use a dedicated client story/bug/epic ticket).
        </li>
        <li>
          I will be subscribed to the

          <a href="http://mail.plebia.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/urgent" target="_blank">urgent</a>
          mailing lists (be sure to filter them to a separate folder
          to look at them only when you need to - but also make sure
          that if any such emails also explicitly include you in the To/CC,
          then they will arrive in your inbox).
        </li>
        <li>
          I will work on the following, listed by decreasing priority:

          <li>
            Handle emergencies from other team members
            (reported by team members directly to me or to the other sprint
            firefighter, with Braden arbitrating priorities)
          </li>
          <li>
            Handle emergencies reported by clients (these will come in through the
            <a href="mailto:help@opencraft.com" target="_blank">help@opencraft.com</a>
            mailing list, which everyone receives, though for anything other
            than obviously unexpected downtime, the firefighters should wait
            for Xavier or Braden to triage and prioritize the issue).
          </li>
          <li>
            Handle critical bugs reported by QA

          <li>
            Complete any personal spillover from the previous sprint
          </li>
          <li>
            Work on client requests that can't wait until the next sprint, in particular in
            the first week of a sprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help ensuring a clean sprint by helping other team members, in particular in the
            second week of a sprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being available on the Open edX Slack (#general), answering questions and
            responding to emergencies reported there (log time on OC-1017)
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch over sandboxes (ie keep an eye on the instance manager
            on a regular basis, few times a day, to ensure they build correctly, and debugging if needed)
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing support on the mailing-list, monitoring for questions
            on features we made (log time on OC-1017)

        <li>
          On Friday or Monday well before the mid-sprint meeting, I will do a sprint checkin
          on all "backlog" and "In progress" tickets (this means to post a comment
          on each ticket to ask how the assignee is doing and if they need help,
          and/or asking them to update the status of the ticket if it is not clear).

        As a <strong>business developer</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I will ensure clear and prompt communication with prospects, leads and clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will regularly look out for business opportunities. This includes
          consulting public tendering platforms, sending cold emails to prospects,
          and attending events where you could meet prospects.
          Strategy and time spent on these tasks should be discussed with Xavier.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will send the official OpenCraft offering presentation materials to prospects.
        </li>
        <li>
          When meeting, I will describe OpenCraft’s offering,
          history and philosophy to prospects.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will quickly gather prospects’ needs through discussion.
          This enables us to know if and how we can help them.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will keep an open mind. Buyers might have needs
          that we can’t fulfill yet - this might be an opportunity
          and should be discussed with Xavier and the team.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a prospect becomes a lead, I will follow-up by providing information,
          drafting quotes, creating epics and issues and documenting in Jira
          as much as possible so the team can follow what’s happening.
        </li>
        <li>
          When managing a project, I will handle communication and coordination
          between the client and the technical team working on the project
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally, when writing to the clients, I will always make sure
          there is either contact@ or help@ CC'd:
          <ul>
            <li>
              anything related to accounting/billing/quote should be on contact@
            </li>
            <li>
              and the rest on help@
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I will manage and monitor Betatester applications
          and addressing user issues in Ocim

      <p>
        As the <strong>week's discovery duty assignee</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I will make sure I am the right person to take on a specific discovery, if I feel I am not
          I will exchange work with other people from the sprint, to get someone else
          to do it, while I help them with their tasks. It is very important to be able to estimate a
          task well, we should make a conscious effort to assign the task to the person who can best
          handle it, if possible (if the person is available and willing to do the work).
        </li>
        <li>
          I will keep at least 10 hours of time to do discovery work
          on any small leads/client requests that come up during the week.
          I may still plan some tasks to pull into the sprint if no fires pop up.
          Before pulling tasks in the sprint, use these hours to help others finishing
          their sprint commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
          If I do some discovery tasks, I will ping the sprint firefighters
          to review the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          As always, if I do the discovery, I understand that I would be expected
          to complete the epic work later on if the client accepts it.
          (To avoid people being forced to commit to being the owner of big epics, any
          huge discovery stories should always be scheduled into future sprints rather
          than directly assigned to the discovery duty assignee.)

        As an <strong>epic owner</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            I will keep clients updated on the status of tickets
            (for clients with long term monthly contracts, this means updating
            their JIRA or Trello boards as work progresses).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I will attend meetings with the client about the project as required,
            e.g. weekly scrum meetings.
            (We try to limit these sort of meetings to once a week per client at the most.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I will create tickets on OpenCraft's JIRA board for upcoming work,
            and place them into the appropriate upcoming sprints
            so that we can get the work done well ahead of applicable deadlines.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I will set the "Original Estimate" of each ticket to the number of hours
            listed in the discovery document. If a ticket covers a larger story
            from the discovery document only partially, I will set its "Original Estimate"
            to an appropriate fraction of the number of hours listed in the discovery document.
            For any ticket that does not directly correspond to a story from the discovery document,
            I will set the "Original Estimate" based on the amount of time that I think
            will be required to complete the work, taking into account the number of hours
            that remain in the epic's budget at that point in time.

        <li>
          <p>
            On Thursday in the second week of a sprint, I will post an epic update
