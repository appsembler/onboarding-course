<p>A Google Apps email of the format <code>your-first-name@opencraft.com</code> has been setup for each team member. You should have received an email with a link to the login page and a temporary password. This Google Apps account will also give you access to Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, and more. When working on OpenCraft projects, please use these Google apps that are provided by the OpenCraft account rather than, say, your personal Gmail or Google Calendar. Similarly, when setting up accounts with other services for use on OpenCraft projects, please also use your OpenCraft email address to sign up.</p>
<p>We use a&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/-/blob/master/tools_we_use.md#core-tools">number of tools at OpenCraft</a> for task management, communication, code, key management, and operations, and you should use your <code>@opencraft.com</code> account to access them.<br /> <br /> Let's configure your OpenCraft e-mail!</p>
