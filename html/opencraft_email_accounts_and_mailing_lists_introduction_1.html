  A Google Apps email of the format
  <code>your-first-name@opencraft.com</code>
  has been setup for each team member. You should have received an email with a
  link to the login page and a temporary password. This Google Apps account will
  also give you access to Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, and
  more. When working on OpenCraft projects, please use these Google apps that are
  provided by the OpenCraft account rather than, say, your personal Gmail or
  Google Calendar.
  Similarly, when setting up accounts with other services for use
  on OpenCraft projects, please also use your OpenCraft email address to sign up.

  Let's configure your OpenCraft e-mail!
