<p>Make sure that your work computer's home folder/partition (or your whole disk) is encrypted, and that any backups of your data are also encrypted. This is important to reduce the risk of someone being able to obtain sensitive data (like client passwords, browser session cookies, etc.) if your computer is stolen/lost.</p>
<p>Please see this <a href="https://forum.opencraft.com/t/root-partition-encryption-documentation/497">forum post</a> for some instructions and suggestions, and read our&nbsp;<a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/security_policy/">security policy</a> for details.</p>
