  <strong>OpenCraft</strong>
  is a service company specializing in the edX platform.
  The core values of OpenCraft are <em>openness</em>, <em>quality</em>,
  <em>commitment</em> and <em>empathy</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Openness</em>: We believe strongly in open source,
  and we aim to make most of our work available to the community
  as open source software.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Quality</em>: We create high-quality code and provide professional support for our work.
  All team members are senior developers with extensive experience in Python,
  Javascript and most of the technologies used by the Open edX project.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Commitment</em>: We do what we say, and do it on time.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Empathy</em>: We actively pay attention to how clients or other team members feel
  about the way we act. Even if sometimes we have to hurt feelings
  or take painful decisions, it's not unnecessarily so.

<h3>OpenCraft's vision</h3>

<p>OpenCraft is trying to be a company that focuses on being doing very high quality work in a sustainable way. We do this by doing open source, and which contributes to a great human endeavour (education). And that unlike most companies and all startups, we aren't focused on hypergrowth and profits, but try to grow in a way that provides a nice lifestyle (remote work, flexible hours, expertise and growth) for everyone on the team.</p>

<p>We want to grow, and don't put a limit on our potential size, but only as long the size doesn't jeopardize the lifestyle or atmosphere. When it does, we stop growing to make sure we are actually able to handle our current size before considering growing bigger.</p>

<p>We also try to maximize how we benefit from automation, to keep us humans busy with the creative/non-automatable work, while delegating the things that are automatable to algorithms. If you know The Culture series by Iain Banks, that should give you a pretty good idea of a (fairly remote) end goal for that aspect of OpenCraft. ;p</p>
