<p>As a newcomer you should:</p><p/><ol><li>
          Not commit to more than <strong>3 points</strong>
          of tasks during your first week, or 5 points your second week
          (so 8 points in a two-week sprint).
          It's really easy to over-commit at first, so keep your commitments manageable.
          If you finish early you can always ask in the
          <a href="https://chat.opencraft.com/opencraft/channels/sprint-planning"><em>Sprint planning</em></a>
          channel whether someone needs any help,
          and take on more work later in the sprint.
        </li><li>
          Provide lots of updates to your assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
          so they can provide timely help.
        </li></ol>
