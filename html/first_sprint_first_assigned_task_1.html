<p>Your first sprint contains a lot of challenges that you were not prepared to face. One of these challenges is
        deciding which task to pick and whether the picked tasks suits your experience and what you're looking to
        achieve in OpenCraft.
      </p><p>During this period, don't forget that your assigned mentor (the "Reviewer 1" on your onboarding task) is
        expected to be very present and proactive during the assignation of tasks, and it would be good to pick them
        together. You are free to pick a selection of tasks suggested by the mentor. However, make sure that
        you really picked the right tasks for you. If your mentor hasn't yet worked with you to find a task (or two)
        for your first sprint(s), please ask them to do so.
      </p><p>
        We would like to emphasize here that the mentor is only an adviser, and ensuring that you take on an
        appropriate workload is on you, as a task owner. As mentioned above, You are free to pick a selection of tasks
        suggested by your mentor, though.
