<p>Part of working for OpenCraft involves doing estimates for clients, and if those estimates are accepted, managing the project  or "epic" that goes along with that work.  Epic ownership is an important part of how we work; it's how we keep our projects on target to the clients' expectations, and how we keep our company budget on track. </p>
<p>As a newcomer, your onboarding epic is your introduction to this process.  Read through the <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/roles/#newcomer" target="_blank">Onboarding epic management section of the Newcomer role</a> for more details about what is involved managing your onboarding epic.</p>
