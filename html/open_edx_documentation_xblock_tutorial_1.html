  <strong>Note:</strong> In the edX XBlock creation tutorial, the database migrations fail because they are expecting

  <strong>Note:</strong> There is an invalid python interpreter command <code>python no</code> mentioned in
  <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/getting_started/create_first_xblock.html#create-the-sqlite-database">
    this page

  of the XBlock tutorial. What they meant is to tell you to type <code>no</code> not
  <strike><code>python no</code></strike>, so be aware.
