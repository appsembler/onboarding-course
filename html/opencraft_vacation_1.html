<p>To request time off please:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure to book holidays from two weeks in advance (for a few days) to a month (for 1+ weeks).
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=auscaqbrvc0uatk6e7126614kk%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">team calendar</a> first to see if anyone else has booked those dates off - we try to avoid having more than two people on vacation at the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you decide to travel and still work, it's useful to let Xavier know. As long as you have a good internet connection and maintain work hours and communication / reactivity levels, you can work from anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are going to take vacation and still work with reduced hours, the above applies, along with notification of your estimated amount of work. Also, add your name and an indication of reduced hours for the time period it applies to on the OpenCraft calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a developer:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Check if you need to make any trades on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix68BsU2hJ2ikexXWeBcqFysfoF4l7IKRghIDQgyfPs/edit#gid=447257869" target="_blank">rotations schedule</a> and if so, get tentative agreement from someone to trade with you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that the epic reviewer for any epic you own is going to be present and is fully informed so they can take over the epic owner duties while you are away.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Email Xavier to ask him to confirm your time off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before leaving for vacation, make sure to set a vacation responder
    indicating dates you will be unavailable and an alternative person and / or
    email to contact in case of urgency (notify the person(s) covering for you).
    Remember to turn the responder off once back to work! Please find instructions
    on how to do it <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25922?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.
