<p>To request time off please:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure to book holidays from two weeks in advance (for a few days) to a month (for 1+ weeks).
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=auscaqbrvc0uatk6e7126614kk%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">team calendar</a> first to see if anyone else has booked those dates off - we try to avoid having more than two people on vacation at the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you decide to travel and still work, it's useful to let Xavier know. As long as you have a good internet connection and maintain work hours and communication / reactivity levels, you can work from anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are going to take vacation and still work with reduced hours, the above applies, along with notification of your estimated amount of work. Also, add your name and an indication of reduced hours for the time period it applies to on the OpenCraft calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a developer:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Check if you need to make any trades on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix68BsU2hJ2ikexXWeBcqFysfoF4l7IKRghIDQgyfPs/edit#gid=447257869" target="_blank">rotations schedule</a> and if so, get tentative agreement from someone to trade with you. If the spreadsheet doesn't yet cover the week(s) you'll be away, there is a place near the bottom where you can add a note, so that we can account for your holiday when the schedule gets updated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that the epic reviewer for any epic you own is going to be present and is fully informed so they can take over the epic owner duties while you are away.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Email Xavier to ask him to confirm your time off.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Before leaving for vacation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    At least a few days before, make sure that every task or review that's assigned to
    you will either be completed or assigned to someone else while you are away. If you
    will be away for an entire sprint, make sure that there are absolutely no tasks
    or reviews in that sprint that are assigned to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you own any epics, transfer any knowledge needed to the epic reviewer, and make
    sure they are still prepared to plan/review all the needed stories and manage the
    epic while you are away.
  </li>
  <li>
    The day before you leave, make sure to set a vacation responder
    indicating dates you will be unavailable and an alternative person and / or
    email to contact in case of urgency (notify the person(s) covering for you).
