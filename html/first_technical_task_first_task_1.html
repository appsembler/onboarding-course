<p>
  Once you have your first technical task assigned by your mentor
  you can start working on it.
</p>
<p>
  The simplest workflow would be:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Change the JIRA status of the ticket you're going to work on to
    <em>In Progress</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do
    <code>git checkout</code>
    of the master branch in the repository you're going to work with. Pull from remote.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a new branch of the master branch. You can name it like:
    <code>your_name/name_of_the_new_feature</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a new feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test your code, both manually and with tests, and make sure
    your code passes quality checks and is generally high-standard
    and readable for a reviewer.
    See the unit about
    <a href="/jump_to_id/opencraft_coding_standards" target="_blank">Coding standards</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Push your branch to remote.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open a pull request on GitHub.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change the JIRA status of your ticket to
    <em>Internal review</em>
    and ping your reviewer.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Important note:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The scenario above describes the simplest possible workflow but please
  do note that workflows can differ drastically for different tasks
  and one needs to ultimately figure out what works best through experience.

  Please make sure you have read the documentation on
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/task_workflows.md" target="_blank">task workflows</a>,
  <a href="/jump_to_id/opencraft_ticket_statuses_1" target="_blank">ticket statuses</a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/Pull_request_process.md#typical-pr-process" target="_blank">typical process</a>
  before starting your work, to understand how workflows may differ
  for more specific scenarios; but again, you should be adaptable.
