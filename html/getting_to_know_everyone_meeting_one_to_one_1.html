    While the weekly sprint meetings will let you talk to your co-workers 
    face-to-face, they don't give you much opportunity to get to know people
    personally. 
</p>
<p>
    As a newcomer you have the option to get to know people better via short
    introductory one-to-one video calls. After you've attended two or more 
    sprint meetings you should have some idea about what everyone's working on 
    so you will be better placed to start having these conversations.
</p>
<p>
    You don't have to talk about work, or coding or anything in particular. Your
    co-workers are spread across the globe and have led vastly different lives
    there is a lot to learn from each other.
</p>
<p> 
    While a video call lets you talk face-to-face, it is not mandatory. You 
    could choose to make an audio-only call, or have a text chat. You can look
