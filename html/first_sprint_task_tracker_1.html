<p>Please visit the JIRA task tracker, especially the Weekly sprint of your cell (<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=26">here</a> for Bebop, <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=24">here</a> for Serenity) and look at some of the tickets on the board, to get a feel for the type of tasks awaiting you in the near future.</p>
<p>You should have an onboarding task assigned to you, with your mentor as your reviewer. Locate that task, and also note the <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/glossary/#epic">Epic</a> linked from that task. Epics are like projects, which are used to group related tasks which may span many sprints. This is your onboarding epic, and we'll discuss it more in the Time Management section of this course.</p>
