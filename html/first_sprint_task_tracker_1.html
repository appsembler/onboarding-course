<p>Please visit the JIRA task tracker, especially the Weekly sprint of your cell (<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=26" target="[object Object]">here</a> for Bebop,&nbsp;<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=24" target="[object Object]">here</a> for Serenity) and look at some of the tickets on the board, to get a feel for the type of tasks awaiting you in the near future.</p>
<p>You should have an onboarding task assigned to you, with your mentor as your reviewer.&nbsp; Locate that task, and also note the Epic linked from that task -- Epics are like projects, which are used to group related tasks which may span many sprints.&nbsp; This is your onboarding epic, and we'll discuss it more in the Time Management section of this course.</p>
