<h3>
  The trappings of working from home
</h3>

<p>
  OpenCraft is a <a href="https://www.remoteonly.org/">remote-only</a> company.
  This style of working has a lot of advantages, but there are also a few things that have the potential to become disadvantages if you are not aware of them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Not working from a "normal" office means that you won't be pulled away from your desk on a regular basis to have a conversation or go out for lunch with your co-workers.
    If you're working all by yourself, there's nobody around to help you get out of your head.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no specific start and end times for your work to structure your day around.
    It can be tempting to tack on extra hours today that you'll pay for in fatigue and burnout tomorrow.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no physical separation between your work and your private life.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These aspects of remote work make it easy to fall into bad habits and spiral downward when you work from home,
  ignoring your mental well-being for long stretches of time and defaulting to an unhealthy situation with zero work boundaries or social interaction.
</p>

<h4>
