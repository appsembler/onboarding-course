<p>We feel that an efficient way to on-board you initially onto how our infrastructure works is to give you a quick overview of the life of an HTTP request sent to an Open edX appserver that we host on OpenStack.</p>
<p>We only cover the Ocim &amp; OpenStack case, since they are quite customized. AWS requests go through a different lifecycle, and since they are more specific to standard AWS deployment setups which you may be familiar with from past work (e.g. using an ELB), we don't cover them.</p>
<p>Additionally, to keep this section compact enough, we only cover the specifically customized pieces. That is, we don't cover the details of a request at the network access layer, nor how Django handles it in the edx-platform -- those and others are things that're common to all Open edX deployments, whether on OpenStack, AWS, or hosted by some other provider entirely.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a <em>lot</em> more to it than this. Our infrastructure is relatively vast and diverse because of the large range of clients we have, the large number of technologies needed to run Open edX successfully, and all of the peripheral things we need to be able to monitor and understand our systems from a higher level.</p>
