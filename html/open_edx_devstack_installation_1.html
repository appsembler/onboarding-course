  The devstack is a complete working install of Open edX on your computer.
  With it, you make changes to code locally and view those changes by visiting
  urls in your browser.
</p>
<p>
  There are two versions of the edX devstack.
</p>
<p>
  A <a href="https://github.com/edx/devstack">Docker version</a>
  and a deprecated <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/howtos/devstack_setup.md">Vagrant version</a>.
  While at some point in time you are likely going to
  need <strong>both</strong> working, you should focus on
  getting the Docker devstack up first.

  (<a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/756384075/Navigating%20the%20Docker%20Devstack%20Presentation.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1528315993270&cacheVersion=1&api=v2">slides</a>),
  given by our own team members, is an optional introduction to the docker
  devstack.

<p>
  Much of the work that Open-Craft creates ends up being upstreamed
  to <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform">edx/edx-platform</a>.
  This repository is the latest code and works very well with the newer Docker
  devstack. While the Vagrant devstack works as well for master work, it can be
  complicated and many people have had issues with getting it to work.
</p>
<p>
  For many client projects, the Vagrant devstack is a <strong>must</strong>.
  <a href="https://github.com/mckinseyacademy/mcka_apros/blob/master/docs/SetupNotes.md">McKinsey Apros</a>
  and legacy systems that are not using the latest edx/edx-platform require
  the use of a Vagrant devstack. Until you are working on one of these tickets,
  or have some free cycles to put towards downloading and waiting it may be best
  to avoid setting up the Vagrant devstack.
</p>
<p>
  Having said that, until things change, you'll eventually need both working.
  If you're not sure which one to choose, please ask the reviewer of your
  on-boarding JIRA task.
