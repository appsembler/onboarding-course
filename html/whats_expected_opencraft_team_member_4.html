<h4>
  Sprint tasks
</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    I will follow the process and expectations outlined in the
    <em>Pull request process</em>
    section (you'll get to this section soon).
  </li>
  <li>
    I will never add my code (even DevOps code!) to a production branch directly
    - I will always create a Pull Request.
  </li>
  <li>
    With the exception of
    <em>trivial changes</em>,
    I will always ensure my Pull Requests are reviewed by another OpenCraft team member <strong>before</strong> merging.
    I may merge <em>trivial changes</em> before receiving a review, but I will ensure all of my <em>trivial changes</em>
    are reviewed and acknowledged post-merge or post-deployment
    by another OpenCraft team member. Trivial changes include:
    <ul>
      <li>
          Small Open edX environment tweaks (
          <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/514483/34581710-c167d10c-f191-11e7-9a66-7fa8c59def82.png">example</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Minor/bugfix package version bumps (
        <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/ansible-rabbitmq/pull/4/files" target="_blank">example</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I will only commit to work each sprint that I believe I can comfortably complete
    within the allotted sprint time (two weeks).
    Here, "complete" means "get merged or to external review."
  </li>
  <li>
    I will get all of my tasks ready for internal review (by someone else
    on the OpenCraft team) by the
    <strong>end of Thursday in the second week of the sprint</strong>
    at the latest. This will ensure that there is time for the review to take place,
    and for me to address the review comments
    and get the internal reviewer's approval in time.  If a ticket potentially requires multiple
    review cycles, get it into review as early as possible.  Schedule reviews with your reviewer
    to make sure they have time when you get your work ready for review.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will get my tasks to at least
    <strong>External Review</strong>
    (or "Merged" if no external review is required) by
    <strong>one hour before the sprint planning meeting for the next sprint</strong>.
    As this is also dependent on the internal reviewer,
    I'll make sure she/he will be available around the time I finish.
  </li>
  <li>
    If it is looking like I will have trouble meeting one of these deadlines,
    I will inform the sprint firefighters (and epic owner) as early as possible,
    so they can get me additional help, start planning for contingencies,
    and/or warn the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    If necessary, I will work overtime to complete my tasks before the end of the sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will "work from the right", prioritizing responding to external reviews
    as the highest priority, then doing reviews / responding to questions
    from others on the team, and finally working on implementing my own "In Progress" tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will be helpful to team members, responding to questions,
    helping with debugging, providing advice, or even taking over tasks
    if I have time and they are overloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a sprint, I will review all of my tasks that are in "Long External Review/Blocked"
    and if needed, I will ping the external reviewer/blocker or pull the task into
    an upcoming sprint.
  </li>
</ol>
