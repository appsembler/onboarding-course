    You can create a task on JIRA on your first week to set up these meetings 
    and set yourself as both Assignee and Reviewer. Schedule it for the next 
    sprint so you can start working on it after your second sprint meeting.

    Depending on how busy everyone is, it is unlikely that you will be able to 
    meet everyone within a single week; set your goals accordingly. Remember
    that most people will be in different timezones than you, so you may need to
    adapt to their schedule.

    It goes without saying that this is just to help you get <em>started</em> to
    know your your colleagues given that people are working from different 
    locations and will rarely meet in meatspace. You can do this once as a 
    newcomer but are free to keep in touch after that in your personal time; we 
    aren't your gatekeepers!
