<p>We've gathered tips and tricks from our team members on working with Open edX devstack. Please read them <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/tips_and_tricks.md" target="_blank">here</a> (especially <em>Tips on the better workflow with devstack</em>).</p>
<p>We also have a forum post with some issues we found and how to fix them <a href="https://forum.opencraft.com/t/devstack-tips-and-tricks-general-discussion/65/22" target="[object Object]">here</a>. Feel free to contribute if you come up with any solutions too.</p>
<p>Also, if you are stuck in any step while setting up the devstack, ping the #Devstack channel on Mattermost.</p>
