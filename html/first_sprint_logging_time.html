<p>All the work we do is billed in hours and tracked through our task management tool (Jira). There, we have a plugin named <strong>Tempo</strong>, where you should log all the time spent on any task.</p>
<p><a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/process/#all-roles">Keep your logged time updated daily</a>, so that task and project managers can manage budgets and client expectations.</p>
<p>You can either track your time manually or use one of the many time tracking tools available online, such as the <a href="https://www.tempo.io/">Tempo tracker tool</a> inside Jira, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>, <a href="https://flowmagic.co/">Flowmagic</a> and <a href="https://clockify.me/">Clockify</a>.</p>
<p>To log time on a task, you can use the following instructions:</p>
<p>1. Open the task in Jira, e.g: <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/BB-628">BB-628</a>;Scrolling down, you'll see a tab named "Tempo".</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ObLR82p.png" alt="tempo tab" type="saveimage" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="746" height="214" /></p>
<p>2. Click on "Log time" and fill in all the fields. Describe what you have done, select the date and time period that you've worked.</p>

<p>3. Your logged time should appear on the "Tempo" section of your Jira task.</p>
<p>To view all the time you logged on a month, you can go to the <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/TempoUserBoard!timesheet.jspa">Tempo timesheet</a> and get a nice view of all your logged time (and make corrections if necessary). You may also enter time here directly if you prefer, rather than needing to visit each ticket for which you need to log time.</p>
