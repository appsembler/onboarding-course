        If you happen to be interested in following that thread, simply click
        "Start watching this issue" on the top right corner under the "People" header
        in JIRA.

        Following conversations on that ticket is a nice way to be relatively up-to-date on
        the state of our infrastructure, any recent problems and incidents, etc. That of course
        doesn't replace the detailed conversations that take place on actual root cause analysis
        documents or tickets, but it's a nice starting point.

        If you yourself find an operational issue that needs to be communicated and triaged,
        note it on the ticket -- don't be shy.
