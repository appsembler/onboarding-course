<p>
  Please find below the description of the OpenCraft process.
  While it might sound a bit convoluted, it's pretty simple in practice:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We work in two-week sprints.
  </li>
  <li>
    On Friday &amp; Monday at the end of a sprint, everyone on the team collaboratively
    and asynchronously plans who will work on what tasks for the upcoming sprint.
    We use the <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/showOpenCraftReport">Sprint Planning Report</a>
    to plan our team's time (that everyone has enough work and nobody will be overcommitted) and
    to collectively make sure we're staying on track with each client's
    monthly budget and each epic/project budget.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a meeting every Monday.  If it's the beginning of a new sprint, we do a final
    review of the plans for the upcoming sprint, then start the sprint.  If it's the middle
    of a sprint, we try to ensure everything is going smoothly, and discuss how to help with
    tasks that are at risk of not being finished by the end of the sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    After that, tasks move from left to right until completion on our JIRA tracker.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Detailed version</h4>

<h5>All Roles</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    In general, "work from the right" - it's better to finish a task that's already in progress than it is to start a whole new task. This reduces context switching, which will help get things done more quickly. With that said, if you are blocked on a task, move on to another task, until unblocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Daily, use the Tempo time tracking on the Jira board to record the time spent on each task and update each ticket being worked on once finished on it for the day. Even just a quick summary or sentence of where you're at with the task is useful to your reviewer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Developer Team</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All tasks are split up into epics, and each epic has an "epic owner."
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Near the end of each sprint, in preparation for the next one, the team
      will do an asynchronous "grooming" session. This means that we each
      estimate the complexity of each task in the upcoming sprint in terms
      of "story points". (Currently, Uman is the one who starts this grooming
      session and invites everyone to it.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We use story points as a shorthand for agreeing about the complexity of a task.
        Story points are meant to be a relatively objective measure of "complexity",
        and not necessarily indicate how long it would take any particular developer to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use a fibonacci scale for story points (please see <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/task_workflows.md" target="_blank">task workflows</a> for more detail on story points for different types of tasks).
      </li>
      <li>
        If anything about the task or the acceptance criteria is unclear,
        post a question as a comment on the task and try to work with the epic owner
        (or the reporter if there is no epic owner) to get it answered before the meeting.
        <br />
        Note that during the asynchronous grooming sessions, any comments/questions
        posted in the estimation session will be lost once the grooming session ends,
        so it's preferable to post questions on the tickets themselves.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Likewise, before the Monday planning meeting, everyone works
      to asynchronously assign each story in the upcoming sprint to a developer
      and a code reviewer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The epic owner is responsible for making sure this happens for each story
        in their epics that must happen in the upcoming sprint. For stories that
        don't have an epic owner, either the tentative assignee (if there is one
        already) or the person who reported the ticket is responsible for doing
        this; this is also documented
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/dev/jira-scripts/blob/bf4ea0ae3447fc2ae2098444c2b13a7d2f9e06c3/ReadyForSprintReminder.groovy#L112-124">in our Jira bot Crafty's code</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Epic owners should also check the
        <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/showOpenCraftReport">Sprint Planning Report</a>
        for the upcoming sprint, ensuring that the tasks the team plans to take on
        for the upcoming sprint are in line with each client's budget and each
        epic's budget.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We have a meeting on Monday via Google Hangouts. There we review the grooming and assignments for the upcoming sprint (please see the <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/sprint_planning_agenda.md" target="_blank">sprint planning agenda</a> for details of this meeting)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you don't see the meetings as recurring events on your calendar,
        ask Xavier to send you the invitation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After the sprint has been planned and started, it's time to code!
      In your first sprint you'll find your first technical task assigned to you
      by CTO. In the next regular sprints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Take a look at the <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5" target="_blank">current sprint board</a>. There are filters at the top such as <em>My Issues</em>, <em>My code reviews</em>, and your name, which can be toggled to show only issues relevant to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drag a task from column to column on the sprint board to update its status
        as you work through it. The various statuses/columns are described below.
        Tasks move from left to right until completion.
      </li>
      <li>
        In general, "work from the right" - it's better to finish a task
        that's already in progress than it is to start a whole new task.
        This reduces context switching, which will help get things done more quickly;
        it also demonstrates reactivity to upstream reviewers
        (which pushes them to be reactive too).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Tempo timekeeping system built into our JIRA board
        for tracking the time you spend on each task.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Admin Team</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Xavier will add task to your board for the week every Monday (or you can add your own tasks). Drag a task from column to column on the sprint board to update its status as you work through it. The various statuses/columns are described below. Tasks move from left to right until completion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Micro communicate. Include links, screenshots, any useful reference when asking questions, commenting, updating on a ticket or any other platform where you're synching with another team member (docs, sheets, Mattermost, emails, etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    Research and seek out resources for any questions you might have that can be solved this way. Any questions for the team or or reviewer, always ask in clear detail. Limit meetings to an absolute minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitor emails for anything you can un-block for the team, client emails to forward and / or answer, instance performance issues or billing questions / notifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work proactively and create and maintain any useful documents needed for record keeping or instructions (this can be anything from a how-to or a FAQ). Make sure to keep anything private that relates to billing and accounting.
  </li>
</ul>
