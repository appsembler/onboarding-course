<p>As you work on tickets you will start receiving emails about them. To reduce the number of notifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/howtos/gmail-filters.md">Use Gmail to filter out emails</a>,
    put them into folders, etc.
  </li>
  <li>Unsubscribe from JIRA tickets and Github notifications that do not relate to what you're working on.</li>
  <li>Disable notifications (such as your phone) while you are working.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set up JIRA to send an email only if your <code>@username</code> is mentioned. Because other people (including your reviewer) might have set it up in this way, always mention the username when you address them directly, so that they be notified.</p>
