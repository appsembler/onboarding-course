<h3>Receiving a Response</h3><p>
        Not to go into detail, but once the Open edX server's nginx service has routed the request to the appropriate
        local port, which corresponds to the LMS port by default, Django kicks in and parses the request, runs it
        through all of the edx-platform's middleware logic, passes it to the correct view, gets back a response,
        and passes that back to the webserver.
      </p><p>
        This response goes back to HAProxy. HAProxy is configured to look for certain HTTP codes.
        Codes associated with server-side errors (in the 5xx range) redirect to <code>/error</code>.
      </p><p>
        HAProxy now sends the response to the client securely, which was the browser.
        You know the rest from here.
