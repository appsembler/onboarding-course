<p>There're multiple tools we use. Please read <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/tools_we_use.md" target="_blank">our docs</a>.</p>
<p>You will be given access to them - unless specified, you won't have anything to do to obtain it.</p>
<p>We also have a custom tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/" target="_blank">Ocim (OpenCraft Instance Manager)</a>, which is what we use to deploy instances and sandboxes. We will go more in depth about it in another section.</p>
