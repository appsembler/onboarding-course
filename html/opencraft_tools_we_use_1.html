<p>There're multiple tools we use. Please read <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/tools_we_use.md" target="_blank">our docs</a>.</p>
<p>You will be given access to them - unless specified, you won't have anything to do to obtain it.</p>
<p>We also have a custom tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/" target="_blank">Ocim (OpenCraft Instance Manager)</a>, which is what we use to deploy instances and sandboxes. We will go more in depth about it in another section.</p>
<p>We also have a link shortener that you can install by adding <code>149.202.185.230 o</code> to your <code>/etc/hosts</code>, and it will translate links to tasks (e.g. <a href="https://o/OC-515">https://o/OC-515</a>), and to other pages (<a href="https://o/board">https://o/board</a>, <a href="https://o/agenda">https://o/agenda</a>, <a href="https://o/timesheet">https://o/timesheet</a>, <a href="https://o/contact">https://o/contact</a>, etc.) See full list at <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/dev/link-shortener/blob/master/nginx-configuration">https://o/links</a></p>
