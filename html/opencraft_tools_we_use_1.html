<p>
  There're multiple tools we use. Please read
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/tools_we_use.md" target="_blank">our docs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You will be given access to them - unless specified,
  you won't have anything to do to obtain it.
</p>
<p>
  Be sure to read the introduction to
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/" target="_blank">Ocim (OpenCraft Instance Manager)</a>,
  which is the custom tool that we use to deploy instances.
  Learning about it will allow you to understand much about our infrastructure,
  so it's recommended that you
  <a href="https://console.opencraft.com/registration/" target="_blank">get an account</a>
  and try to use it soon.

  We also have a link shortener that you can install by adding
  <code>149.202.185.230 o</code> to your <code>/etc/hosts</code>,
  and it will translate
  links to tasks (e.g. <a href="https://o/OC-515">https://o/OC-515</a>),
  and to other pages
  (<a href="https://o/board">https://o/board</a>,
  <a href="https://o/agenda">https://o/agenda</a>,
  <a href="https://o/timesheet">https://o/timesheet</a>,
  <a href="https://o/contact">https://o/contact</a>, etc.)
