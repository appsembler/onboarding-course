<h3>Task selection</h3>
<p>All of the tasks of OpenCraft are listed in the Backlog (<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=26&amp;view=planning.nodetail&amp;quickFilter=256" target="[object Object]">Bebop</a>, <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=24&amp;view=planning" target="[object Object]">Serenity</a>)&nbsp;where it contains sections that identify groups of tasks. These sections are mainly the <strong>Stretch Goals</strong> section and <strong>Sprint Tasks</strong> sections which include the tasks we selected as Ready for Development under a certain sprint like the current, and the upcoming sprints. Tasks under <strong>Stretch Goals</strong> section are additional tasks that will be Ready for Development in case a developer finished his/her assigned tasks before the end of the sprint.</p>
<h4>Step by step</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Backlog page of your cell:&nbsp;<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=26&amp;view=planning.nodetail&amp;quickFilter=256" target="[object Object]">Bebop</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=24&amp;view=planning" target="[object Object]">Serenity</a></li>
<li>Look at tickets in the upcoming sprint, starting at the top. (Tickets are generally sorted by descending priority)</li>
<li>You can use ticket color to determine which tickets to look at: If the left border of a ticket is <span style="color: green;">green</span>, that means the ticket already has both an assignee and a reviewer, and so there is no need to look at it in more detail.</li>
<li>If it's not your first sprint, try to find some tasks from projects (a.k.a. epics) that you already worked on. (We do want newcomers to work on different types of tasks, but some degree of continuity is also important to keep the amount of context switching sane.) Colored epic labels help with this.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p><em> It's not necessary to look at all of the tasks on the Backlog page to prepare for the next sprint, you just need to look into tasks from the upcoming sprint section to pick the set of tasks you'll be working on. </em></p>
<h3>When to start picking?</h3>
<p>Usually the time to start picking tasks for the next sprint is in day 11 (Friday) of the current sprint, as most of your tasks (ideally all of them) are going to be in internal/external review and team members will be busy with the review process. By this time, you'll always get the chance to know how much load you're gonna be able to take in the next sprint. Check the <a href="http://opencraft.com/doc/handbook/process/">Process for sprints</a> section in the Handbook for extra details.</p>
