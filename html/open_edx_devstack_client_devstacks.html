<p>We manage servers for different clients (see <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/maintained_instances.md" target="_blank">list of important maintained instances</a>). Most use an upstream Open edX release (slightly modified to run on our infrastructure), but others, like Pearson or McKinsey, need a special branch because they have more customizations that haven't been merged upstream yet. The previous document lists whether an instance uses a custom branch or not.</p>
<p>Before you work on a task, make sure of whether it requires a special devstack. Using the same devstack to switch between very different versions is known to cause problems, so if possible keep separate devstacks for separate Open edX versions.</p>
