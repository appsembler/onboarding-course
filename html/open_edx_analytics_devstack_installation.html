<p><strong>You will not need this now! Come back to the these instructions if you need an Analytics devstack for a particular client.</strong></p>
<p>The Open edX Analytics Developer stack, known as the Analytics Devstack, is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/edx/devstack">Open edX Developer Stack</a>. It provides all of the services and tools needed to modify the Open edX Analytics Pipeline, Data API, and Insights projects.</p>
<p>OpenCraft's clients wouldn't be using the Analytics Developer Stack (unless they wanted to make changes to any of edX's analytics repos themselves). However, OpenCraft hosts production deployments of <a href="https://insights.edx.org/">edX Insights</a> for a few clients. So if you're about to work with one of these <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/maintained_instances.md">clients</a> you might need to install the Analytics Developer Stack.</p>
