<p>
  If I'm
  <strong>new to the team</strong>, I will
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Not commit to more than 3 points of tasks during my first week,
    or 5 points my second week (so no more than a total of 8 points for
    the first sprint).  It's really easy to over-commit at first,
    so keep your commitments manageable. You can always take on more work
    later in the sprint if you finish early.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide lots of updates to my assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
    so they can provide timely help.
  </li>
</ol>
