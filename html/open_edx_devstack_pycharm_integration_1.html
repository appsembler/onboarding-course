  <b>Note:</b> there is currently <a href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000210730-Pycharm-Debugger-hangs-when-using-with-docker-compose">a problem</a> with hanging debugger with docker-compose in PyCharm. The hack for this is to create separate config for running debug with additional option `--noreload`. Please check <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-24191">this YouTrack ticket</a> to see the issue status.
