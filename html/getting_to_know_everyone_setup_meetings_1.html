    Setting up the actual meetings can be a challenge when people are working 
    from different timezones and have vastly different schedules. You can ping
    people any way you want, preferring asynchronous means to avoid the need
    for instant replies. 
</p>
<p>
    One option is to send everyone an email inviting them to schedule a meeting.
    The email should mention the task you've created, so they know where to log
    the time, and remember to mention your timezone and availability in UTC. 
    Do this as early in the sprint as possible so people have time to respond 
    and figure out the time that suits them best. Once you've scheduled all
    the meetings, you can mark this task as merged while the meetings continue
    over multiple sprints.

    You can also ping people on the JIRA ticket itself. This should 
    automatically send them an email linked to the ticket where they can log 
    time and all the essential details mentioned above can be part of the ticket
    description.

    Whatever method you use to set up meetings, 
    <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> can be useful while scheduling
    them. It lets you define your availability and share a link that lets 
    invitees select a free time-slot on your calendar that suits them as well.
    If you find this useful, you can ask 
    <a href="mailto:xavier@opencraft.com">Xavier</a>, and he will set you up 
    with an account at OpenCraft's expense there.
