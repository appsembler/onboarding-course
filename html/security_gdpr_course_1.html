<p>As we sometimes deal with sensitive information about clients' students, we are all required to complete a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/intro-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/learn/v4/overview">GDPR course</a>. The course takes about an hour to complete, and consists of a series of short slide presentations with a set of multiple choice questions after each presentation.</p>
<p>Your mentor will be able to provide the access credentials for this.</p>
