<p>
  We do also use sandboxes. Please read
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/sandboxes_howto.md" target="_blank">Sandboxes HOWTO</a>
  to learn how to work with sandboxes, which help reviewers test your code.
</p>
<p>
  Note that although you will have sandboxes automatically
  provisioned for you, you will not have access to
  <a href="http://console.opencraft.com/" target="_blank">OpenCraft Instance Manager</a>'s UI
  yet because of the elevated priviledges it provides,
  but do still skim over parts of the document related to it.
