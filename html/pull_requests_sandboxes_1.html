<p>We do also use sandboxes. Please read <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/howtos/sandboxes.md">Sandboxes HOWTO</a> to learn how to work with sandboxes, which help reviewers test your code.</p>
<p>Note that although you will have sandboxes automatically provisioned for you, you may not have access to <a href="http://console.opencraft.com/">OpenCraft Instance Manager</a>'s UI yet because of the elevated privileges it provides, but do still skim over parts of the document related to it.&nbsp; If your task requires that you use the instance manager's UI, ask your task reviewer or mentor for access.</p>
