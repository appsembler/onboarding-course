  On GitHub, go to
  <code>Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Authorized OAuth Apps</code>
  and check if any of the authorized applications are unnecessary.
  Take a while to check what applications request read-only and
  especially read-write access to organizations you belong to
  (as you'll get access to some private organizations shortly).
