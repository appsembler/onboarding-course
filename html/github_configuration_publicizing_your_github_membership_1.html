  Please
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/" target="_blank">publicize your membership</a>
  in the OpenCraft GitHub organization, once you get granted access.
  This is necessary so you'll have permission to trigger Jenkins CI builds
  for pull requests against the upstream edx-platform repository.
