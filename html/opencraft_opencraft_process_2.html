  <li>
    We work in two-week sprints.
  </li>
  <li>
    On Friday &amp; Monday at the end of a sprint, everyone on the team collaboratively
    and asynchronously plans who will work on what tasks for the upcoming sprint.
    We use the <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/showOpenCraftReport">Sprint Planning Report</a>
    to plan our team's time (that everyone has enough work and nobody will be overcommitted) and 
    to collectively make sure we're staying on track with each client's
    monthly budget and each epic/project budget.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a meeting every Monday.  If it's the beginning of a new sprint, we do a final
    review of the plans for the upcoming sprint, then start the sprint.  If it's the middle
    of a sprint, we try to ensure everything is going smoothly, and discuss how to help with
    tasks that are at risk of not being finished by the end of the sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    After that, tasks move from left to right until completion on our JIRA tracker.
