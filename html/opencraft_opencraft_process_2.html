  <li>
    We work in two-week sprints.
  </li>
  <li>
    On Friday &amp; Monday at the end of a sprint, everyone on the team collaboratively
    and asynchronously plans who will work on what tasks for the upcoming sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a meeting every Monday.  If it's the beginning of a new sprint, we do a final
    review of the plans for the upcoming sprint, then start the sprint.  If it's the middle
    of a sprint, we try to ensure everything is going smoothly, and discuss how to help with
    tasks that are at risk of not being finished by the end of the sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    After that, tasks move from left to right until completion on our JIRA tracker.
