<p>
  To allow McKinsey to open an account in their system (to get more privileges,
  test features), they need you to
  <a href="https://app.hellosign.com/s/564f47ff" target="_blank">sign a NDA and fill a form</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The onboarding is done by Xavier/Braden as documented <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/onboarding_steps_manager.md#onboarding-core-developers-to-mckinsey" target="_blank">here</a>. In case some setup is needed for accessing resources related to McKinsey, like say the QA Bastion server and Splunk, you will receive the instructions from edX via email once your accounts are setup.&nbsp;
