<p>Please see below for the ticket statuses we use in our JIRA tracker, and what they each tend to represent.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Backlog:</strong>
  Most tasks start here.
</p>
<p>
  The tasks at the top of the backlog are the ones with the highest priority.
  It is usually Xavier or Braden who create and prioritize the tickets
  according to the client's needs; except during discovery tasks for large epics,
  when the person who does the discovery will create the tasks.
  In general, if you have an idea for a new task,
  don't hesitate to ask either Braden or Xavier, or propose it on UserVoice.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>This week</strong>:
  This is the list of tasks assigned to individuals and
  expected to be finished by the end of the sprint.
</p>
<p>
  Once you start working
  on a task, you should move it to the next column.
  <br />
  <br />
</p>

<p>
  <strong>In progress</strong>:
  Tasks that are currently being worked on.
</p>
<p>
  While you work on the task, log the time you worked on the task progressively
  ("Log work"). You can also push to your remote branch regularly.
  <br />
  Once you are finished, create a Pull Request and move the task
  to the next column. Add the Pull Request to the task by clicking
  More &gt; Link &gt; Web Link, and pasting the URL of the Pull Request.
  (If you have many PRs, add them to the description or use a checklist,
  so that you can indicate the status of each PR by marking them with a check
  or strikethrough as they are merged, which cannot be done when using a simple link.
  See
  <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-1064" target="_blank">OC-1064</a>
  as an example.) Also, be sure to notify the person who will review your work.
  (Mentioning their username in a comment on the task is usually enough.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Internal review</strong>:
  Finished tasks that wait for an in-house review.
</p>
<p>
  The reviewer will look over the code and test it, leaving feedback
  on the pull request. Once all of the reviewers' concerns have been addressed,
  the reviewer should give a "" (+1 / thumbs up) comment to indicate
  that they've approved the PR. The task can then proceed to the next column,
  which is usually "External Review."
  <br />
  If the corrections to be made are fairly trivial, the reviewer should
  give a conditional +1, e.g. say "+1 if you fix the minor issues a and b."
  That way, the author won't be blocked waiting for a trivial follow-up review.
  <br />
  If there are many corrections to be made, the task should be moved back to
  <strong>In Progress</strong>
  by the reviewer.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>External Review/Blocked</strong>:
  Finished tasks with an upstream pull request, or tasks
  that are waiting on something (like a code review) from anyone outside of OpenCraft.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, all Pull Requests should reach this state ahead of the end of the sprint
  to leave time for reviewing and corrections.
  <br />
  These tasks are usually awaiting the owner of an upstream repo to review
  and merge the changes. This external reviewer is often another team at edX or a client.
  <br />
  If the one who does the merge is from within the OpenCraft team,
  he can move the task forward. Otherwise, you should regularly check
  if the PR is merged, and move it yourself.
  <br />
  If you (the assignee) do not expect any progress on the ticket
  in the upcoming sprint, you should move the ticket to the
  "Long External Review/Blocked" sprint, so that it won't be cluttering up the
  sprint board and so that your commitments for the upcoming sprint are
  more certain.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Ready for merge</strong>:
  Finished internal review, and external review (if applicable);
  ready for merge.
</p>
<p>
  Once all comments from the review have been fixed
  to the satisfaction of the reviewers, and every reviewer has given their +1,
  the task is ready for merge. The reviewer who gives the final +1 should
  move the task into this column (or you can as the assignee).
  If you can merge the PR yourself, go ahead and do so; if you can't,
  then ping Braden to let him know this is good to merge &amp;
  deliver to the client.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Merged</strong>:
  The task is merged.
</p>
<p>
  You are essentially done with the task. Once it's passed on to the client,
  Braden will move it forward to
  <strong>QA / Client Verification</strong>, and then Xavier will move it to
  <strong>Done</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Long External Review/Blocked</strong>:
  Tasks in this category are not part of the current sprint.
</p>
<p>
  This category is for tasks that are waiting for an external review
  or some other external requirement, and are not expected to be unblocked
  before the end of the current sprint. If any tasks in this category
  are assigned to you, you should review them once a week to see
  if you need to ping the external party to remind them to review/unblock it,
  or if you are ready to pull it back into a sprint.
</p>
