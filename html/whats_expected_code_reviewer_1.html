<p>
  As a <strong>code reviewer</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I will give prompt, thoughtful, thorough, constructive code reviews.
  </li>
  <li>
    (When reviewing OpenCraft work): I will expect that the PR author
    has done everything outlined in the
    <em>PR expectations</em>
    part of the
    <em>Pull request process</em>
    section (you'll get to it soon) - if not, I will ask them
    to fix that before I start the review.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will always read through the code diff, considering things like:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is the code easily understandable by humans?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the code of high quality?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are all relevant coding standards followed?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are all UX / a11y / i18n considerations addressed?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is this introducing tech debt?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the new code well covered by tests?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I will always test the code manually,
    either locally or on a sandbox, unless there is no reasonable way to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will always check if any updates to the software's documentation are required,
    and either ask the author to update the docs,
    or ensure the relevant documentation team is pinged.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is any part of the code that I am not confident in reviewing,
    I will indicate that in my comments.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is any part of the code or PR that I particularly like,
    I will say so - we want to reinforce good practice as well as flagging issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will
    <a href="https://github.com/settings/replies" target="_blank">set up the following template as a "Saved Reply" in GitHub</a>
    and use it for the "stamp of approval" on all PRs I review:
  </li>
</ol>
<pre>
:+1:

- [ ] I tested this: (describe what you tested)
- [ ] I read through the code
- [ ] I checked for accessibility issues
- [ ] Includes documentation
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a screenshot showing how to conveniently access this template
  when completing a code review using the dropdown button in the top right
  of the review panel (on the "Conversation" tab only):

</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>
    If I'm the assigned reviewer for someone who is new to OpenCraft,
    I will reserve extra time to provide additional mentoring and support,
    and I will be especially responsive to questions.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <em>If the assignee is clearly behind the schedule and doesn't respond to pings
    on the ticket: if there's no response at all in 48 hours,
    the code reviewer should ask the firefighter to take the task over
    in order to reduce the risk of spillover.</em>
