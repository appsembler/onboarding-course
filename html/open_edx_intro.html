<p>The Open edX project is a web-based platform for creating, delivering, and analyzing online courses. You can get to know the Open EdX architecture a little better&nbsp;<a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/architecture.html#open-edx-architecture" target="[object Object]">here</a>, take a look before going forward on this chapter.</p>
<p>OpenEdX periodically releases stable versions of the platform called <strong>named releases</strong>. Since not every instance/client uses the same release, it's useful to know how the releases work and what's the current one. Take a moment to read&nbsp;<a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-docs/en/latest/named_releases.html" target="[object Object]">Open EdX Named Releases</a>&nbsp;before setting up your development environment.</p>
<p>Most of the codebase is&nbsp;coded in&nbsp;<strong>Python 2.7</strong>, with the exception of the <a href="https://github.com/edx/cs_comments_service" target="[object Object]">forum service</a>, which is coded in Ruby.</p>
