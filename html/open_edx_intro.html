  The Open edX project is a web-based platform for creating, delivering, and
  analyzing online courses. You can get to know the Open EdX architecture a
  little better
  <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/architecture.html#open-edx-architecture"
  target="_blank">here</a>, take a look before going forward on this
  chapter. These
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/174esosfPeoofe8HXkFx-9utUEwUSpxapZbwgLMgcrik">slides</a>
  and speaker notes are a useful big picture overview of the components and
  scope of open source edX platform from which OpenCraft's client focused work
  is based.

<p>
  We recommend taking each repository as it comes into play with your tasks. To
  begin, these are the repos cloned by the devstack.

  The main one is
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/">edx-platform</a>. It is huge
 and has recently focused on putting dependencies into other repos. It relies
 directly on
 <a href="https://github.com/edx/cs_comments_service">cs_comments_service</a>,
 the Ruby language Discussion forum, and
 <a href="https://github.com/edx/xqueue">xqueue</a>, a frontend to the 3rd
 party task queue software.
</p>
<p>
  Other peripheral utilities are course-discovery and ecommerce, which are more
  interrelated than they should be, but not required for the base platform. The
  rest are utilities and plugins. The src directory (in the devstack) is to
  store local versions of XBlocks or plugins when you are working on them.
</p>
<p>
  A final major repo is
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/configuration">edx/configuration</a>, which
  holds Ansible code to provision new servers with a running edx installation.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding Python versions,
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/">edx-platform</a> (e.g. LMS or
  Studio) is python2.7. Our own
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft">Ocim product</a>
  (OpenCraft Instance Manager) is python3, as are some newer Open edX
  components which run as independently deployed applications (e.g.
  <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/blockstore">blockstore</a>). Many
  edx-platform dependencies (e.g.
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/XBlock">xblock</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/completion">completion</a>) are now
  bi-compatible, using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/six/">six</a>, and get
  tested on both versions. Details are in the tox.ini for those repos. The
  <a href="https://github.com/edx/cs_comments_service" target="_blank">forum service</a>
  is coded in Ruby.
</p>
<p>
  OpenEdX periodically releases stable versions of the platform called
  <strong>named releases</strong>. Since not every instance/client uses the
  same release, it's useful to know how the releases work and what's the
  current one. Take a moment to read
  <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-docs/en/latest/named_releases.html" target="_blank">Open EdX Named Releases</a>
  before setting up your development environment. The edx.org site uses
  continuous deployment. OpenCraft maintenance contracts include upgrades to
  new major releases of Open edX. We are considering moving to continuous
  deployment ourselves.
