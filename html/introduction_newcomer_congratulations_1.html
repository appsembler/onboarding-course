<p><strong>Welcome to the team!</strong></p>
<p>This course is meant to help you to get started on the team, and become familiar with the way we work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We recommend you go through the course and related documentation progressively, but we don't recommend that you read everything all at once. This course is broken up into Weeks, with information specific to the initial weeks of your trial period.&nbsp; After the Weeks, the sections dedicated to specific types of tasks, and these are the best read when you've taken on a task of that type.</p>
<p>Keep track of the time you spend here so you can invoice it on your Onboarding ticket, even if you start this course ahead of your start date.</p>
<p>We hope that this course will help answer your questions, but feel free to reach out if you need anything.</p>
