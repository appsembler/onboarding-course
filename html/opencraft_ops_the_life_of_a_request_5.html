<h3>Sending the Request</h3><p>
        IP in hand, your browser can initiate the HTTP request, because the lower layers of the network
        now know how to route it.
      </p><p>
        When HAProxy first receives the request through one of its frontend listeners, it actually rewrites
        it to use HTTPS rather than HTTP by default.
      </p><p>
        HAProxy terminates SSL connections to all Open edX backends on OpenStack, so after the TCP handshake
        completes, the connected parties enter the TLS exchange. We have all SSL certificates for our Open
        edX instances sitting on the HAProxy servers, which is what HAProxy provides the browser during that exchange.
      </p><p>
        A secure connection now allows the HTTP request to make its way to HAProxy safely. Once it's there,
        HAProxy tries to match the URL of the request with a domain that is configured to be linked to a
        particular HAProxy backend.
      </p><p>
        HAProxy opens a connection with the backend in question, which is protected with basic authentication
        (e.g. username/password), and sends the authentication information in a header with the HTTP request.
