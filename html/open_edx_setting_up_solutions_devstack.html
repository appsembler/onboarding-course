<p><strong>You will not need this now! Come back to these instructions if you need a Solutions devstack for a particular client.</strong></p>
<p>When working with any McKinsey tickets, it's important to know that they have their own heavily-customized fork of edx-platform based on ginkgo, and that's called the&nbsp;<strong>Solutions Fork</strong>.&nbsp;To be able to run and work on the solutions fork, you will need to set up a <strong>Solutions devstack</strong>. Fortunately, since there's a lot of developers working on this all the time, it doesn't have nearly as many issues to set up as a normal Vagrant devstack.</p>
<p>Aside from all the common components you find on a normal devstack, Mckinsey uses a <strong>custom&nbsp;frontend&nbsp;called Apros</strong> instead of LMS, and it needs to be provisioned after the solutions devstack it set up.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/howtos/how-to-work-with-mckinsey.md">How to work with Mckinsey</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>To set up a complete&nbsp;<strong>Solutions Devstack</strong>, follow the procedures below.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Follow the procedures on&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/edx-solutions/edx-platform/wiki/Setting-up-the-solutions-devstack#initial-machine-provisioning">Setting up the solutions devstack</a>.</p>
<p>2. After that, you should have a working solutions fork devstack running on vagrant. Check if the LMS and Studio are working correctly.</p>
<p>3. The next step is to set up&nbsp;<strong>Apros</strong>, and you can do that by following&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mckinseyacademy/mcka_apros/blob/master/docs/SetupNotes.md">Setting up McKinsey Academy (Apros) with a local LMS Installation</a>.</p>
<p>Again, if you find any bumps while provisioning step 2, troubleshoot, fix the issue and run&nbsp;<code>vagrant provision</code> again. Some issues that you've faced while provisioning a normal vagrant devstack might happen here too.</p>
<p>If the LMS, Studio and Forum are correctly configured, you shouldn't have any issues setting up Apros.</p>
