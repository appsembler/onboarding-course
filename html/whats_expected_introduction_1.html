<p>
  We have prepared the descriptions of different roles in OpenCraft
  in the form of
  <strong><em>What's expected of me</em></strong>
  docs.
  If some of them (like sprint firefighter or discovery duty) don't apply to you yet,
  take note at least of how you as a newcomer can benefit from what they do.
  Let's read them!
