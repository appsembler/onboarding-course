<p>
        Please participate in the grooming session (point estimation) that
        the team does at the end of each sprint.
        Usually you should get an email about this and can follow the link
        to reach the estimation page, but if not, try
        <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/projects/OC?selectedItem=com.spartez.jira.plugins.jiraplanningpoker:pokerng-project-side-panel-link&amp;rapidView=5&amp;source=sidebar" target="_blank">this link</a>
        to see if you have been invited to any session. When grooming, you
        don't have to provide a number of points for every issue (or even
        most) - put '?' if you don't feel you have enough knowledge to
        estimate a task.
      </p>
