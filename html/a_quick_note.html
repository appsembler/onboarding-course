<p>You may not be able to open some Github/Gitlab links from within this course due to one (or more) of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>You are not logged in using appropriate credentials.</li>
<li>You were not granted the access to the linked repository.</li>
<li>The repository completely moved to another address.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>If one of the last two cases happened to you, you need to reach the reviewer of your onboarding ticket to determine next steps</p>
