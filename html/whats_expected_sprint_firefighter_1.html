    As a
    <strong>sprint firefighter</strong>:
  </span>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I will keep at least 10 hours of time for sprint firefighter duties as
    described below, and will proactively pursue those duties.
    I may still plan some tasks to pull into the sprint if no fires pop up.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will not record any time on the
    <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-1199" target="_blank">OC-1199</a>
    task directly (always use a dedicated client story/bug/epic ticket).
  </li>
  <li>
    I will be subscribed to the
    <a href="http://mail.plebia.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/help" target="_blank">help</a>
    and
    <a href="http://mail.plebia.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/urgent" target="_blank">urgent</a>
    mailing lists (be sure to filter them to a separate folder
    to look at them only when you need to - but also make sure
    that if any such emails also explicitly include you in the To/CC,
    then they will arrive in your inbox).
  </li>
  <li>
    I will work on the following, listed by decreasing priority:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Handle emergencies from other team members
      (reported by team members directly to me or to the other sprint
      firefighter, with Braden arbitrating priorities)
    </li>
    <li>
      Handle emergencies reported by clients (these will come in through the
      <a href="mailto:help@opencraft.com" target="_blank">help@opencraft.com</a>
      mailing list, which everyone receives, though for anything other
      than obviously unexpected downtime, the firefighters should wait
      for Xavier or Braden to triage and prioritize the issue).
    </li>
    <li>
      Handle critical bugs reported by QA
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploying hotfixes/security fixes on client instances
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide reviews for tasks that are missing a reviewer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Complete any personal spillover from the previous sprint
    </li>
    <li>
      Work on client requests that can't wait until the next sprint, in particular in
      the first week of a sprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      Help ensuring a clean sprint by helping other team members, in particular in the
      second week of a sprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      Being available on the Open edX Slack (#general), answering questions and
      responding to emergencies reported there (log time on OC-1017)
    </li>
    <li>
      Watch over sandboxes (ie keep an eye on the instance manager
      on a daily basis to ensure they build correctly, and debugging if needed)
    </li>
    <li>
      Providing support on the mailing-list, monitoring for questions
      on features we made (log time on OC-1017)
    </li>
    <li>
      Work on additional tasks from the backlog if additional time is available
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>
  Also, if I am
  <strong>Firefighter 1</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I will lead the meeting on Monday
  </li>
  <li>
    On Friday or Monday well before the mid-sprint meeting, I will do a sprint checkin
    on all "backlog" and "In progress" tickets (this means to post a comment
    on each ticket to ask how the assignee is doing and if they need help,
    and/or asking them to update the status of the ticket if it is not clear).
  </li>
</ul>
