<p>In some tasks, you'll need to add on change functionality on <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/glossary/#ocim">Ocim</a>, and for that you will need to set up a <strong>Ocim devstack</strong>. </p>
<p>In order to make the installation easier, we'll provision a vagrant machine containing all the tools needed to run a fully featured Ocim instance locally. To do that, use the following instructions:</p>
<p>1. Install VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine.</p>
<p>2. Clone the ocim repo to a directory of your choosing with <code>git@github.com:open-craft/opencraft.git</code></p>
<p>3. Follow the instructions under <a href="https://ocim.opencraft.com/en/latest/installation/#vagrant-installation">Vagrant install</a>. After successfully completing these steps, you should have a functioning Ocim devstack.</p>
<p>4. In order to to run a Ocim server and provision/create Open EdX instances and Appserver, you will need to <a href="https://ocim.opencraft.com/en/latest/configuration/">configure environment variables</a> that give it access to our OpenStack account used for testing. You can use the credentials on <a href="https://gitlab.com/opencraft/documentation/private/blob/master/opencraft-im.env">this file</a> for testing your changes to Ocim locally.</p>
<p>Don't forget to read the entire documentation on Ocim to make sure you know how to use it.</p>
