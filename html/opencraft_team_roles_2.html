<h3>Developer</h3>
<p>
  There are three types of developers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Additional developers:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Short-term developers (temporary contractors),
        who have been hired for a specific task, scope of period of time.
        They are the most external members of the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        Newcomers on probation (2 months, reconductible).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Core team member - the new recruits who have been confirmed become core team members.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Core team members differ from additional developers in that they tend to have more
  team-based responsibilities. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Core team members are on a
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix68BsU2hJ2ikexXWeBcqFysfoF4l7IKRghIDQgyfPs/edit#gid=447257869" target="_blank">weekly rotation schedule</a>,
    where they often have to take on some additional roles, including
    Sprint Firefighter, being on Discovery Duty, and occassionally leading our
    weekly sprint kick-off meeting.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, in all other regards, all types of developers are put
  to the same expectations -- no politics or special treatment between
  short-term developers, newcomers, and core team members.
</p>
<p>
  The only acceptable exception is when providing extra mentoring on tasks
  for newcomers (or anyone known to not have much context in the task),
  which is expected and useful.

<h3>Other Roles</h3>
<p>
  Sprint firefighters, discovery duty, and epic owners
  (in the next section you'll learn more details on these roles).
  The "sprint firefighter" and "discovery duty" roles are on a rotation schedule,
  with different people assigned each week.
</p>

<h3>Client owner</h3>
<p>
  For each client, we have a single person who is designated as the owner for that client, called
  the "client owner." The client owner is responsible for handling most communications with that
  client. The client owner is the person who is assigned to the epic or task with the name
  "&lt;Client name&gt; [General] Support", such as <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-2340">OC-2340</a>
  or <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-2910">OC-2910</a>. If nobody is assigned to
  such an epic, or it doesn't exist, the epic owner of the current year's
  <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/browse/OC-4105">Small Projects &amp; Customizations epic</a>
  is the default client owner.
</p>
<p>
  In general, regardless of which email address the client sent their question to, the client owner
  should be the one who replies, though they may hand off any conversation to anyone on the team as
  needed (such as a firefighter). If someone else received the email, please "Reply All" to pass the
  message on to the client owner for them to reply (add the client owner to the "To" field, and add
  "OpenCraft &lt;help@opencraft.com&gt;" to the CC field, and say something like "Passing this on
  to (client owner name)").
</p>
<p>
  There are a few exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If it's an urgent problem, whoever sees it first should reply and CC the firefighters,
    help@opencraft.com, and the client owner. One of the firefighters should respond.
  </li>
  <li>
      If it's a general issue/question:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the email is related to a specific project/epic with a different epic owner, that epic owner can
          reply directly (make sure the client owner and "OpenCraft &lt;help@opencraft.com&gt;" are CC'd).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the client owner is away, their designated backup person (usually the reviewer on the
          "Support" epic/ticket for that client) should take over this role. (Or the firefighers
          if no backup person was planned.)
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We have a few clients with monthly development budgets. For those clients, the assigned client owner
  is also responsible for reviewing the monthly budget before and during each sprint planning meeting,
  to ensure that we are not going too far above or below the budget. They should refer to the
  <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/showOpenCraftReport">Sprint Planning Report</a>
  which can monitor and project the status of each budget as of the end of the upcoming sprint.
</p>
<p>
  When we get a new client, or when the client owner changes (or we start working with a new
  person coordinating things on the client's side), we send them
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFBgmq5QA318IfVLBbg9owuqyVl7e4UX5ZWsFQl-u6o/edit">a welcome email</a>
  explaining who the client owner is and how to contact us.
