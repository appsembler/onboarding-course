<h3>Developer</h3>
<p>
  There are three types of developers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Additional developers:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Short-term developers (temporary contractors),
        who have been hired for a specific task, scope of period of time.
        They are the most external members of the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        Newcomers on probation (2 months, reconductible).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Core team member - the new recruits who have been confirmed become core team members.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Core team members differ from additional developers in that they tend to have more
  team-based responsibilities. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Core team members are on a
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix68BsU2hJ2ikexXWeBcqFysfoF4l7IKRghIDQgyfPs/edit#gid=447257869" target="_blank">weekly rotation schedule</a>,
    where they often have to take on some additional roles, including
    Sprint Firefighter, being on Discovery Duty, and occassionally leading our
    weekly sprint kick-off meeting.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, in all other regards, all types of developers are put
  to the same expectations -- no politics or special treatment between
  short-term developers, newcomers, and core team members.
</p>
<p>
  The only acceptable exception is when providing extra mentoring on tasks
  for newcomers (or anyone known to not have much context in the task),
  which is expected and useful.
