<h3>A word about stress</h3>
<p>"A state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances." - <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/stress"> Oxford dictionnary</a></p>
<p>"Increased stress results in increased productivity – up to a point, after which things go rapidly downhill." - <a href="https://www.stress.org/what-is-stress"> stress.org</a></p>
<p>At OpenCraft, we care about the stress level of our team members. Stress is a normal reaction to any challenge, but individuals experience stress in very different ways. Make sure you know what stress level you are comfortable with, and take actions when it's getting too high for too long.</p>
<h4>What are some techniques for reducing chronic stress?</h4>
<p>"The key is to prevent long-term elevation or abnormal regulation of stress-related biological factors and to maximize the time spent in the resting state. From what we know so far, it’s pretty much grandma’s advice: Sleep well, eat and exercise in moderation, and engage in activities that help you feel relaxed and rested."</p>

<p>"It is important to find what works for you and then to do it consistently. Consistency may be more important than intensity, so a brisk walk on a frequent and regular basis for reasonable amounts of time may be more helpful than jogging as fast as you can once every few weeks. Genuine support from friends and family can also be an effective chronic stress buffer." - Read full article by <a href="http://stanfordmedicine.org/communitynews/2012fall/stress.html"> Stanford Medicine</a></p>
<p>Your fellow team members are your allies when it comes to reducing stress. Talk to them, let them know that you're experiencing high levels of stress, and they will help you find solutions to prevent it : )</p>
