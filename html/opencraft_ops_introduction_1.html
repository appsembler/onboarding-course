        OpenCraft's engineering staff are all expected, at least at some level, to be
        capable of DevOps-y tasks. At some point or another, you'll likely be involved in
        SSHing into machines, looking at graphs of metrics of our infrastructure,
        performing root cause analyses, deploying new servers, configuring machines with
        Ansible, and so on.

        For that reason, it's recommended you get familiar with our infrastructure and how
        we generally handle operations, so you're prepared in advance.
