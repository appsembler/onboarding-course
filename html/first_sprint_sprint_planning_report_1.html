<p>
We use an internally-developed application called <a href="https://sprints.opencraft.com">Sprints</a> to help us manage our time commitments during the sprint planning sessions.
</p>
<p>Have a look at your cell's <a href="https://sprints.opencraft.com">Sprint Planning Report</a> and make sure it shows the correct number of hours under "Goal" (how much time you'll have to work) for the upcoming two-week sprint.
  This number should be lower by 2 than your contracted number of hours, because 2 hours are reserved for the weekly sprint meetings.
</p>
<p>
  This dashboard also shows your tasks that need to be estimated <a href="https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/sprint_planning_agenda/#before-the-meeting">before the sprint planning meeting</a>.
