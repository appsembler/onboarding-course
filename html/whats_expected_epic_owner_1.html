  As an <strong>epic owner</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      I will keep clients updated on the status of tickets
      (for clients with long term monthly contracts, this means updating
      their JIRA or Trello boards as work progresses).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I will attend meetings with the client about the project as required,
      e.g. weekly scrum meetings.
      (We try to limit these sort of meetings to once a week per client at the most.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I will create tickets on OpenCraft's JIRA board for upcoming work,
      and place them into the appropriate upcoming sprints
      so that we can get the work done well ahead of applicable deadlines.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On Thursday in the second week of a sprint, I will post an epic update
      that answers these questions:

      On Thursday or Friday in the final week of each sprint, I will assign
      upcoming stories from this epic that need to be done next sprint
      to myself - or I will ask others from the team
      to be either the assignee or the reviewer.
      (If the epic owner is away, the epic reviewer is responsible for this.)
