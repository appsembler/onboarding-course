<p>If you need to inform everyone or discuss something with the whole company, you can post on the <a href="https://forum.opencraft.com/">forum</a>.</p>
<p>To only address the core team, send an email to <a href="mailto:dev@opencraft.com">dev@opencraft.com</a> - but since we default to communications open to everyone, prefer posting on the forum unless there is something that really needs to be kept private to the core team (there is pretty much only the newcomer reviews being posted there).</p>
<p>Generally in your communications, make sure you give access to them to the whole team as much as possible, or even publicly, including in cases when it would be possible to hold the conversation privately - either with a client or another team member, ensure all your communications are held in tools that provide access to other team members, and have archives: forum, Jira, public channels on Mattermost, or CC'ing at least one <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/mailing_lists.md">mailing-list</a> - it makes it easier to reference communications in other places (by providing a URL to reference).
</p>
<p>If you need to ask questions which are not related to any task, e.g. about holidays or contract, email <a href="mailto:braden@opencraft.com">Braden</a> or <a href="mailto:xavier@opencraft.com">Xavier</a>.</p>
